## Gameplay Instructions

Once the game loads up, tap the screen to get started.

You will begin your run across the terrain, finding obstacles both on the ground, and in the air for you to avoid. Tap once to jump, and double tap to toggle ducking.

Running into an obstacle will result in the game ending, but don't fret, as you can easily restart and go again.

If playing this game in browser, substitute left mouse clicks for taps.
